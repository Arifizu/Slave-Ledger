# Tracking the Slave Exports of the 19th Century: A Ledger of Exploitation

This project seeks to explore the massive amount of slave exports in the early 19th century by analyzing where in Africa the slaves were taken from, and examining when and where they were sent to on their voyage across the waves. Through the data provided, we hope to reveal trends and historical and cultural background of various regions of the western hemisphere, and later analyze the effects of this influx of a foreign culture held under duress.
